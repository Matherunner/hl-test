Half-Life Physics Reference
===========================

.. caution::
   This documentation is work in progress!

This is an unofficial documentation for the physics governing the Half-Life_ universe. There have been many very comprehensive wikis for games in the Half-Life series, such as the `Half-Life Wikia`_ and the `Combine OverWiki`_. These wikis focus on the storyline and casual gaming aspects of the Half-Life series video games. There is also a wiki for practical speedrunning aspects of these games, namely the `SourceRuns Wiki`_. Even years after Half-Life's release, one can still find casual gaming or speedrunning communities around the game.

Despite the wealth of strategy guides for Half-Life, it is next to impossible to find documentations describing the physics of the game with a satisfying level of technical accuracy. One can only speculate about the reasons behind such scarcity. Knowledge about the physics of Half-Life is important for developing tools for Half-Life TAS production and for the process of TASing itself. The nature of the in-game physics demands highly precise tools. Perhaps more importantly, developing an understanding and intuition for Half-Life physics is vital in producing a highly optimised TAS for the game.

Thus, this documentation strives to detail all aspects of the physics in a way that would help any curious minds to gain a much deeper appreciation for Half-Life and its speedruns. The potential tool developers will also find this documentation a helpful guide. This documentation should serve as a definitive reference material for Half-Life physics.
